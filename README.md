# Random Word Generator: 

Gets a list and/or single random word from portland.craigslist.org.

* **Overview:**
  - The Random Word Generator uses the "*For Sale -> Free*" section of *Portland's Craigslist*. 
  - It finds all the words, eliminates "boring" ones ('them,' 'these,' etc.), and anything under 4 letters.
  - It then makes an array of 'em ('words'), and plucks off the first one ('word') for you to do with what you wish.
  - **PRO:** Nothing more random than free Portland Stuff.
  - **CON:** If Craigslist changes their formatting, this would no longer work. (**UPDATE:** They *did* change formatting, but I just updated the regex pattern.)

* **Getting Started**
  - Download 'random_word_generator.php.'
  - Save it to a php-enabled server/directory.
  - Go, go, go...
